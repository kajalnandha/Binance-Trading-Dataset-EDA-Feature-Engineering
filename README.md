# **Binance Trading Dataset â€“ EDA & Feature Engineering**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**  
This project analyzes **90 days of historical trade data** from various Binance accounts. The dataset includes:  
- **Port_IDs** â†’ Unique identifiers for trading accounts  
- **Trade_History** â†’ Details of past trades, including timestamps, assets, trade side (Buy/Sell), prices, and more  

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objective**  
The goal is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering (FE)** to extract meaningful financial insights, clean the dataset, handle missing values, and rank trading accounts based on key performance metrics.  

## **ðŸ“Š Key Metrics Calculated**  
For each account, we compute:  
- **ROI (Return on Investment)** â†’ Measures profitability  
- **PnL (Profit and Loss)** â†’ Net earnings or losses  
- **Sharpe Ratio** â†’ Risk-adjusted returns  
- **MDD (Maximum Drawdown)** â†’ Largest decline from peak value  
- **Win Rate** â†’ Percentage of profitable trades  
- **Win Positions** â†’ Count of successful trades  
- **Total Positions** â†’ Total number of trades  

## **ðŸ“ˆ Ranking Algorithm**  
A custom ranking algorithm is developed to evaluate trading accounts based on the computed financial metrics, identifying the **top 20 best-performing accounts**.  

## **ðŸ“‘ Documentation & Insights**  
The analysis includes:  
- **Data Cleaning** â†’ Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies  
- **Feature Engineering** â†’ Creating new meaningful variables  
- **Findings & Assumptions** â†’ Key observations based on the dataset  

ðŸš€ **This project provides valuable insights into trading performance, helping optimize strategies based on real data!**
